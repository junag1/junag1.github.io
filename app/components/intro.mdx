Juna Gregersen

I am a Massachusetts Institute of Technology freshman. 
While I have not declared a major, I hope to double major in Course 20 (Biological Engineering) and Course 15-2 (Business Analytics) with a potential minor in Biomedical Engineering.

Presentations/Literature Reviews I have created in programs during high school include:
