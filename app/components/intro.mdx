# Juna Gregersen

I am a Massachusetts Institute of Technology freshman.
While I have not declared a major, I hope to double major in Course 20 (Biological Engineering) and Course 15-2 (Business Analytics) with a potential minor in Biomedical Engineering.

Presentations/Literature Reviews I have created in programs during high school include:

- [Nanotechnology for Treating Type I Diabetes](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGPNodGJcI/WXlJM2W_yBTSabtCUlrYIA/edit?utm_content=DAGPNodGJcI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) ([pdf](/files/nanotech-diabetes.pdf))
- [Effects of Exam Stress on the Immune System](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGDYTIvXFg/bbTsvsTBEn7LV_Sq_sgjuA/edit?utm_content=DAGDYTIvXFg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) ([pdf](/files/exam-immune.pdf))
